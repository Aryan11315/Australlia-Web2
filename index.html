    <h2 style="color: red;">Culture</h2>
    <img src="Australian-Bush-Tucker-Indigenous-Australian-Food-Practices.webp" alt="Culture of Australlia" style="height: 50px; width: 50px;">
     <p>Australian culture is of primarily Western origins, and is derived from its British, Indigenous and migrant components.

Indigenous peoples arrived as early as 60,000 years ago, and evidence of Aboriginal art in Australia dates back at least 30,000 years.[1] The British colonisation of Australia began in 1788 and waves of multi-ethnic (primarily Anglo-Celtic) migration followed shortly thereafter. Several states and territories had their origins as penal colonies, with this convict heritage having an enduring effect on Australian music, cinema and literature.[2]

Manifestations of British colonial heritage in Australia include the primacy of the English language and Western Christianity, the institution of constitutional monarchy, a Westminster-style system of democratic parliamentary government, and Australia's inclusion within the Commonwealth of Nations. The American political ideals of constitutionalism and federalism have also played a role in shaping Australia's distinctive political identity.</p>
    <h2>Wildlife</h2>
    <p>
        The fauna of Australia consists of a large variety of animals; some 46% of birds, 69% of mammals, 94% of amphibians, and 93% of reptiles that inhabit the continent are endemic to it.[2]: 4  This high level of endemism can be attributed to the continent's long geographic isolation, tectonic stability, and the effects of a unique pattern of climate change on the soil and flora over geological time. A unique feature of Australia's fauna is the relative scarcity of native placental mammals.
